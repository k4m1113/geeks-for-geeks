                    Find the sum of all bits from numbers 1 to N.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N.

Output:

Print the sum of all bits.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

Example:

Input:
2
4
17

Output:
5
35

Explanation:
An easy way to look at it is to consider the number, n = 4:
0 0 0 = 0
0 0 1 = 1
0 1 0 = 1
0 1 1 = 2
1 0 0 = 1
Therefore , the total number of bits is 5
