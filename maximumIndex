                    Given an array A of integers, find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].
Example :
A : [3 5 4 2]
Output : 2 
for the pair (3, 4)

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases.  Then following T lines contains an integer N depicting the size of array and next line followed by the value of array.

Output:
Print the maximum difference of the indexes i and j in a separtate line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100

Example:
Input:
1
2
1 10

Output:
1
