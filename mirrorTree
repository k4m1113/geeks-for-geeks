                    Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.


             

Input:
The task is to complete the method that takes one argument, root of Binary Tree and modifies the tree.

Output:
The function should conert the tree to its mirror

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 75
1 <= Number of nodes<= 100
1 <= Data of a node<= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 R 1 3 L
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
2 1 3
30 10 60 20 40 

There are two test casess.  First case represents a tree with 3 nodes, 2 edges. Here root is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.   Second test case represents a tree with 4 edges and 5 nodes.

 

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given above are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console, and should not print anything on stdout/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
                     
                        ** For More Input/Output Examples Use 'Expected Output' option **
