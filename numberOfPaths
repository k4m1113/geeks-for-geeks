                    The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a  MxN matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move to right or down.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is M and N, M is number of rows and N is number of columns.

Output:
For each test case, print the number of paths.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ M,N ≤ 10

Example:
Input
2
3 3
2 8
Output
6
8
