                    Write a function to print the depth first traversal for a undirected graph from a given source s.

Input:
The task is to complete the function DFS which takes 3 arguments an integer denoting the starting node (s) of the dfs travel , a  graph (g)  and an array of visited nodes (vis)  which are initially all set to false . 
There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:
The function should print the depth first traversal for the graph from the given source. 

Note : The expected output button always produces DFS starting from node 1.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 100
1 <=Number of  edges<= 100

Example:
Input:
1
4
1 2 1 3 1 4 3 5

Output:
1 2 3 5 4    //dfs from node 1
 

There is  one test cases.  First line of each test case represent an integer N denoting no of edges and then in the next line N pairs of values a and b are fed which denotes there is an edge from a to b .
