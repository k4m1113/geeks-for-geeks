                    Given two arrays of integers, write a program to check if a pair of values (one value from each array) exists such that swapping the elements of the pair will make the sum of two arrays equal.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of first array. Third line of each test case contains M space separated integers denoting the elements of second array.

Output:
For each test case, print 1 if there exists any such pair otherwise print -1.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=10000
1<=M<=10000

Example:
Input:
2
6 4
4 1 2 1 1 2
3 6 3 3
4 4
5 7 4 6
1 2 3 8
Output:
1
1
