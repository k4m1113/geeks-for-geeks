                    Given a number, check whether it is sparse or not. A number is said to be a sparse number if in binary representation of the number no two or more consecutive bits are set.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Â The first line of each test case is number 'N'.

Output:
Print '1' if the number is sparse andÂ '0' if the number is not sparse.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 100
1 <=n<= 100

Example:
Input:
2
2
3

Output:
1
0
