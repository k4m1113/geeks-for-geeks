                    Given a binary tree in which each node element contains a number. Find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another.

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N, denoting number of nodes. Second line of every test case consists of N Spaced 3 elements, Parent node data, child node data and position of child node( 'L'  or  'R' ).

Output:
Return the Maximum possible sum.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=30

Example:
Input:
