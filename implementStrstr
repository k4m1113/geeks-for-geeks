                    Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns and integer denoting the first occurrence of the string x in s.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two strings s and x.

Output Format:
For each test case, in a new line, output will be an integer denoting the first occurrence of the x in the string s. Return -1 if no match found.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't have to take any input. Just complete the strstr function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1<= |s|,|x| <= 1000

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
                     
                        ** For More Input/Output Examples Use 'Expected Output' option **
