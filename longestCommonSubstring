                    Given two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’, find the length of the longest common substring.

Examples :


Input : X = "GeeksforGeeks", y = "GeeksQuiz"
Output : 5
The longest common substring is "Geeks" and is of
length 5.

Input : X = "abcdxyz", y = "xyzabcd"
Output : 4
The longest common substring is "abcd" and is of
length 4.

Input : X = "zxabcdezy", y = "yzabcdezx"
Output : 6
The longest common substring is "abcdez" and is of
length 6.


 

Input:
First line of the input contains no of test cases  T,the T test cases follow.
Each test case consist of 2 space separated integers A and B denoting the size of string X and Y respectively
The next two lines contains the 2 string X and Y.


Output:
For each test case print the length of longest  common substring of the two strings .


Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=size(X),size(Y)<=100


Example:
Input:
2
6 6
ABCDGH
ACDGHR
3 2
ABC
AC
