                    Given two numbers represented by two lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is list representation of addition of two input numbers.

Suppose you have two linked list 5->4 ( 4 5 )and 5->4->3( 3 4 5) you have to return  a resultant linked list 0->9->3 (3 9 0).

Input:

In this problem, method takes two argument: the head of the first and second linked list. The function should not read any input from stdin/console.
The struct Node has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element of the linked list. 
There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:
Add  two numbers represented by linked lists.

Note: If you use "Test" or "Expected Output Button" use below example format
Constraints:

1<=T<=100

1<=N<=100
Example:

Input:

2

2

4 5

3

3 4 5

2

6 3

1

7

Output:

0 9 3  

0 7

Explaination:

5->4 //linked link repsentation of 4 5

5->4->3// linked list representation of 3 4 5

0->9 ->3 // linked list representation of 3 9 0 resultant linked list.
                     
                        ** For More Input/Output Examples Use 'Expected Output' option **
