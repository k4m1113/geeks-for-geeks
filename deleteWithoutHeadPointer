                    You are given a pointer/reference to a node to be deleted in a linked list. The task is to delete the node.  Pointer/reference to head node is not given.  

You may assume that the node to be deleted is not the last node.

Input:

You have to complete a method which takes one argument: pointer/reference to a node to be deleted.  There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.


Example:
Input
2
2
1 2
1
4
10 20 4 30
20

Output
2
10 4 30 

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console, and should not print anything on stdout/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
                     
                        ** For More Input/Output Examples Use 'Expected Output' option **
