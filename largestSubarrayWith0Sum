                    Given an array having both positive an negative integers . Your task is to complete the function maxLen which returns the length of maximum subarray with 0 sum . The function takes two arguments an array A and n where n is the size of the array A . 

Input:
The first line of input contains an element T denoting the No of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains a number denoting the size of the array A. Then in the next line are space separated values of the array A .

Output:
For each test case output will be the length of the largest subarray which has sum 0 .

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
-1000<=A[]<=1000

Example:
Input
1
8
15  -2  2  -8  1  7  10 23

Output
5

Explanation
In the above test case the  largest subarray with sum 0 will be -2  2  -8  1  7

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.

 
                     
                        ** For More Input/Output Examples Use 'Expected Output' option **
