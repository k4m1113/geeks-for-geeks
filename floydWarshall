                    The problem is to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed Graph.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow . The first line of each test case contains an integer V denoting the size of the adjacency matrix  and in the next line are V*V space separated values of the matrix (graph) .

Output:
For each test case output will be V*V space separated integers where the i-jth integer denote the shortest distance of ith vertex from jth vertex.

Constraints:
1<=T<=20 
1<=V<=20
-1000<=graph[][]<=1000

Example:
Input
2
2
0 25 25 0
3
0 1 43 1 0 6 43 6 0

Output
0 25 25 0 
0 1 7 1 0 6 7 6 0
