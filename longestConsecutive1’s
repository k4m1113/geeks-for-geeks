                    Given a number N, Your task is to find the  length of the longest consecutive 1's in its binary representation.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the length of the longest consecutive 1's in N's binary representation.

Constraints:
1<=T<100
1<=N<=1000
