                    Given a positive integer N, count all possible distinct binary strings of length N such that there are no consecutive 1’s. Output your answer mod 10^9 + 7.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contain an integer N representing length of the binary string.

Output:
Print the count number of binary strings without consecutive 1’s of length N.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100

Example:
Input:
2
3
2

Output:
5
3

Explanation:
Testcase 1: case 5 strings are (000, 001, 010, 100, 101)
Testcse 2:  case 3 strings are (00,01,10)
