                    Given a graph with N nodes and M directed edges. Your task is to complete the function kosaraju which returns an integer denoting the no of strongly connected components in the graph.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers N and M . In the next line are N space separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v.

Output:
For each test case in a new line output will an integer denoting the no of strongly connected components present in the graph.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N,M<=20
1<=u,v<=N
