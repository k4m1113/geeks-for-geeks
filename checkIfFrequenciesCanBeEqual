                    Given a string s which contains lower alphabetic characters, the task is to check if its possible to  remove at most one character from this string in such a way that frequency of each distinct character becomes same in the string.
Examples:


Input  : s = “xyyz”
Output : 1
We can remove character ’y’ from above 
string to make the frequency of each 
character same. 

Input : s = “xxxxyyzz” 
Output : 0
It is not possible to make frequency of 
each character same just by removing at 
most one character from above string.




Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string s.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print 1 if its possible to make frequencies of all characters equal else print 0.

Constraints:
1<=T<=1000
1<=length of strings <=10000

Example:
Input:
2
xyyz
xxxxyyzz
Output:
1
0
